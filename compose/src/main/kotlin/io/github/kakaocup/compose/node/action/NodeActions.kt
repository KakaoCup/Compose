     * Due to the batching of events, all events in a block are sent together and no recomposition will
     * take place in between events. Additionally all events will be generated before any of the events
     * take effect. This means that the screen coordinates of all events are resolved before any of
     * the events can cause the position of the node being injected into to change. This has certain
     * advantages, for example, in the cases of nested scrolling or dragging an element around, it
     * prevents the injection of events into a moving target since all events are enqueued before any
     * of them has taken effect.

     * Example of performing a swipe up:
     * ```
     * onNodeWithTag("myComponent")

     * onNodeWithTag("myComponent")
     *     .performTouchInput { click(percentOffset(.2f, .5f)) }
